## Description:
With Search & Replace you can search for everything and replace this with everything **but before** you do this you can easily **create** a simple **database backup** and restore it.

#### *Backup Database* tab
**Urgent: Backup your database!**

Please **always** backup your database before performing search/replace operations.


For avoiding problem please keep in mind that this plugin search and replace strictly  what is specified in "Replace With".


Common error example:

Search For: http://web.com/wordpress/

Replace With: http://neuweb.com/wordpress

The url become something like:
http://neuweb.com/wordpresscontent/...



Correct "Replace with": 

Search For: http://web.com/wordpress/

Replace With: http://neuweb.com/wordpress/

The url become something like:
http://neuweb.com/wordpress/content/...



**Multisite usage:**

If you are running a WordPress multisite and want to export the tables of all sites, run the plugin on the main site. Using the plugin on a subsite will only backup the tables of that subsite.

#### *Replace Domain/URL* Tab
If you want to migrate your site to another domain, please enter here your new domain URL, then download a sql file with the replaced URLs. Import this file into the database of your WordPress installation on your new domain.

Please enter the new domain name including "http://" or "https://", as shown in the 'search' field.

If you want to replace the database-prefix, check the checkbox "replace database prefix" and enter your new prefix in the filed below. Don't forget to set the new prefix in the wp-config.php of your new installation!

Press *Replace Domain URL* button to download your SQL file for migration.

**Multisite usage:**
If you are running multisite and want to migrate the tables of all sites, run the plugin on the main site. Using the plugin on a subsite will only migrate the tables of that subsite. The plugin will also replace the domain names (without http(s)://) in the *wp_blogs* table.

#### *Search and Replace* Tab
**Please backup your database before any search/replace!**

Enter your search/replace values and select the tables you want to search. Click on "Do search/replace" to start the operation.
By default, the checkbox "Dry run" is checked. In "dry run"- mode, you get a detailed preview of the changes. No changes will be written to the database. Please check always with "dry run" first.
If you want to apply the changes, uncheck the "dry run"-button, choose if you want to download a sql dump with the changes, or write them into the database. Then click "do search/replace" again.

**Multisite usage:**

If you are running multisite and want to search the tables of all sites, run the plugin on the main site. Using the plugin on a subsite will only show the tables for that subsite.
